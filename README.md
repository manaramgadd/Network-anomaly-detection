# Network-anomaly-detection
The exponential growth of network traffic has led to an increase in network
anomalies, such as cyber attacks, network failures, and hardware malfunctions.
Network anomaly detection is a critical task for maintaining the security and
stability of computer networks.
# Implementation
In this notebook, we will implement Clustering Using K-Means and Normalized Cut, using  ”KDD Cup 1999” dataset, which is a widely used benchmark dataset for network anomaly detection. 
Clustering is a technique for finding similar groups in data, called clusters. Clustering is often called an unsupervised learning task as no class values denoting an a priori grouping of the data instances are given.
This dataset contains network traffic data collected from a simulated environment, including features such as protocol type, service, source and destination IP addresses, source and
destination ports, and attack types.  You will use the kddcup.data_10_percent for training and corrected.gz for testing.
# Evaluation
We will evaluate models based on their ability to detect network anomalies
accurately.
• Precision
• Recall
• F1 score
• Conditional Entropy
